Tiny MYSQL project

Design data modeling that user and bank!
(Design Entity Relationship Diagram)
And make PROCEDURE that can fill DB and can active services of ledger.



DATA MODELING

Step 1 : Identity of Entities
There are Bank-Account, UserId, Cards(debit and credit), Cash...

Step 2 : Define the attributes
Um.. I make up at least attributes in one Entity with related things

Step 3 : Determine the relationships
ex)
ㅣㅡㅡㅡㅡㅡㅡㅡㅡㅡㅡㅡㅡㅡㅡㅡㅡㅡㅡ
ㅣBank       
ㅣand   ->  Bank_Account -> Cards..
ㅣUser  
ㅣㅡㅡㅡㅡㅡㅡㅡㅡㅡㅡㅡㅡㅡㅡㅡㅡㅡㅡ


Step 4 : Specify the cardinalites
One to N..  
But very minimal funtionality are in this modeling.
So its diffrent with real bank's relationships.
:(

Step 5 : Validate the data model
Is there something inconsistencies things?
um.. 
I broke the rules of bank's relationships. 
Sorry

Step 6 : Translate the data model into a database schema
yeah..

Step 7 : Think what else to consider
!!Exception handling of something like 'Null', Over spend money, error... etc.
